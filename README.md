# Immortal

> **This fork:** patched screensaver build (full SMB libraries, SMB EXIF rotation,
> shuffle without repeats). See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for how to download and install it.

A custom home-screen layer for discontinued Meta Portal devices — a play on *Portal*, and on
keeping it alive after Meta wound the platform down. Immortal turns a Portal into a device you
own: your launcher, your screensaver, and an app store that installs a curated catalog
on-device, with remote self-update so it improves over time without a cable.

Package: `com.immortal.launcher` · Target: Meta Portal — **Android 9** (API 28: the 2018 Portal /
Portal+ and the Portal TV) and **Android 10** (API 29: the 2019 and 2021 models), arm64, no Google
services. Touch models and the remote-driven **Portal TV** are both supported.

## What's in it

- **Launcher** (`HomeActivity`) — a fullscreen app grid with a clock/date/weather header and an
  optional charge indicator (shown only on Portal Go, which has a battery). A photo-style
  **Screensaver** button sits top-left; a **Manage** button bottom-right. Manage mode lets you
  remove apps (tap the ✕) and organise the grid into **folders** by dragging one app onto
  another — name them, rename them, and drag apps back out, just like a phone. A green **Calls**
  tile bridges to the stock dialer/contacts for WhatsApp and Messenger calling.
- **Screensaver** (`PhotoDreamService` / `PhotoFrameController`) — a photo frame with stock-style
  clock/battery/date/weather widgets and a choice of **clock faces** (flip clock, big, bold, minimal)
  with size options. Point it at a folder of **your own photos and videos**, an **iCloud shared
  album**, a self-hosted **Immich** library, a **network share (SMB)** or **WebDAV** server, or any
  **web page** — most of which you can set up from your phone by scanning a QR code — or use the
  keyless built-in feed (Lorem Picsum, Unsplash-ready). Weather is keyless Open-Meteo + IP
  geolocation. It cooperates with the Portal's presence sensor so it runs as a **permanent frame**
  while someone's around (and on mains power), and on the battery-powered **Portal Go** an optional
  "sleep when nobody's around" setting saves power. Swipe to change photos, tap to exit. There's
  also a **digital-clock** screensaver as an alternative to the photo frame, a **welcome-back**
  greeting overlay, and an **ambient almanac** line fed by keyless on-device calendar packs
  (Romanian name-days & Orthodox feasts, Irish holidays, prayer times).
- **Tools** (`ToolsActivity`) — a **Tools** tile on the home grid gathers the built-in utilities:
  **RTSP cameras**, **countdowns** (also shown as home-screen chips), a **reading lamp**,
  **bedtime stories** read aloud, a Wi-Fi **intercom** to another Portal, **kitchen timers**,
  **sticky/voice notes**, a **unit/currency converter**, **ISS pass** times, an **aurora outlook**,
  and a Cloudflare **speed test**. All keyless and on-device.
- **Ambient & sound** (`ChimeConfig` / `SunriseConfig`) — optional gentle audio cues (an hourly
  chime, spoken time, a golden-hour tone) with a nightly quiet-hours window, and a **sunrise
  wake-light** that eases the screen up in the morning. All off by default and configured on-device.
- **App Store** (`StoreActivity` / `StoreCatalog`) — a hosted JSON catalog
  ([`catalog.json`](catalog.json), schema v2) rendered with app icons, search, per-app detail
  pages (author, source, website, credit), device-compatibility badges, and an "Updates" section
  for installed apps. F-Droid entries resolve the current APK at install time so the catalog never
  goes stale; your own apps use a direct `apkUrl`. **The store is open to community submissions** —
  every catalog PR is CI-validated. Built a Portal app? [Get it listed](SUBMISSIONS.md).
- **Multi-room audio & now-playing** (`MultiRoomService` / `NowPlayingHub`) — group your Portals as
  synced whole-home speakers with [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) and
  [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/), and see what's playing — title, artist, cover art,
  and play/pause/skip controls — on the home header and screensaver of **every** Portal in the group,
  not just the one driving playback. AirPlay cast into a group works too. There's also a compact
  now-playing mini-player whenever anything is playing on the device itself.
  ([Design notes](docs/design/multi-room-audio.md).)
- **Smart-home integration** (`MqttService`) — Immortal can publish the Portal's state and accept
  commands over **MQTT**, so the device shows up in **Home Assistant** as something you can see and
  control (including turning its screen on and off).
- **Fleet management** (`FleetAgentService`) — an optional always-on WiFi service for managing a
  Portal over the network — deploy and update apps, push config, browse files, read logs — without
  reaching for a USB cable each time. It survives reboots (unlike adb-over-WiFi on these non-root
  devices) and is opt-in per device (`provision.sh --fleet`).
- **Help tour** (`HelpActivity`) — a friendly, non-technical walkthrough on a Help tile (and once
  on first launch), so anyone can pick up a revived Portal.
- **Portal TV support** — full remote/D-pad navigation across the whole UI, a Calls tile that
  bridges to the TV's stock home, and an Immortal tile that appears on that stock home so you can
  hop back.
- **Universal installer** — on the Gen-1 Portal+ (Android 9) the *built-in* Android installer
  dialog is broken (renders white-on-white with no visible buttons), so sideloading normally fails.
  The provisioning kit fixes this for the whole device by **disabling the Meta display overlay**
  (`com.facebook.aloha.rro.niu.android`) that re-themes the dialog white-on-white — a change that
  survives a reboot — so the stock installer dialog becomes usable. Immortal's store and self-update
  then install through Android's standard installer; an **"Install with Immortal"** handler
  (`ApkInstallActivity`) catches any APK you open from Chrome or a file manager, and an **"Install an
  APK"** browser (`ApkBrowserActivity`) lists APKs in your Downloads. (The kit also grants Immortal
  the install-source permission, since the Portal's on-device "install unknown apps" toggle doesn't
  work.) For Play-Store apps via **Aurora Store**, use Aurora's *Shizuku* installer with Shizuku
  (`provision.sh --shizuku`) — see
  [Play-Store apps on a first-gen Portal](#play-store-apps-via-aurora-on-a-first-gen-portal) below.
  Newer Portals have a working installer and don't need the Gen-1 fix.
- **Self-update** (`UpdateManager`) — Immortal polls [`version.json`](version.json); when it
  advertises a higher `versionCode`, it downloads and installs the new build over itself. No
  cable, no laptop.
- **Provisioning kit** ([`provisioning/`](provisioning/)) — one double-click per device: installs
  Immortal, optionally sets it as the home screen and screensaver, and can freeze OS updates so
  the setup sticks. Fully reversible (`Restore-Portal` / `--restore`).

## Install on a Portal

The easiest path is the [provisioning kit](provisioning/): connect the Portal over USB-C with
ADB enabled, then double-click `Provision-Portal` (macOS/Linux) or `Provision-Portal.bat`
(Windows). It fetches the latest release automatically.

To build from source instead:

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.immortal.launcher/.HomeActivity
```

## On first-gen Portals (Portal+ Gen-1, Android 9)

Immortal runs on the original Portal+ too — launcher, screensaver, and app store all work. There's
one quirk worth knowing up front, because it's a quirk of that hardware's older software, not a
fault in Immortal:

**The first-gen Portal's built-in Android installer is broken** — it opens a confirm dialog rendered
white-on-white, with the "Install" button invisible in the bottom-right corner, so apps can't be
installed the normal way. The cause is one of Meta's display overlays
(`com.facebook.aloha.rro.niu.android`) re-theming the dialog — a great community discovery by
[u/keremimo](https://www.reddit.com/user/keremimo/) on r/FacebookPortal. The provisioning kit
**disables that overlay** (`cmd overlay disable`), which brings the normal, readable dialog back. The
framework remembers this across reboots, so once the kit has run, the app store, "Install with
Immortal," and sideloading all install through the standard Android dialog — no cable and no re-setup
needed. (The kit also grants Immortal the install-source permission directly, since the Portal's
on-device "install unknown apps" toggle is non-functional.)

If you'd rather leave the stock dialog untouched, set `DISABLE_INSTALLER_OVERLAY=false` in
`config.env` — but on a Gen-1 Portal the installer dialog then stays unreadable, so installs won't
work until you re-enable the fix. (On newer Portals the overlay isn't present, so this setting has no
effect there.) Everything else works across reboots regardless: your home screen, screensaver, and
every app you've already installed.

The **Portal TV** is the same generation (Android 9), so the same install mechanics apply. It has
no touchscreen, but Immortal is fully driveable with the TV remote — the home grid, folders, App
Store, and screensaver settings all navigate with the D-pad.

Newer Portals (Portal Go, Mini, gen-2) have a working installer dialog and don't need the overlay
fix — installs go through the standard Android installer out of the box.

### Play-Store apps via Aurora on a first-gen Portal

[Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com) lets you install Play-Store apps (Spotify, etc.) without a
Google account. On the Gen-1 Portal+, Aurora's default "Session" and "Native" installer modes hit
the broken stock installer dialog. The cleanest path is Aurora's **Shizuku** installer, which
installs silently through a privileged broker.

The provisioning kit sets this up for you: it **installs Shizuku and starts its server**
automatically. So all that's left is to point Aurora at it, a one-time, two-tap step:

1. Install **Aurora Store** from the Immortal App Store.
2. In **Aurora → Settings → Installation → Installation method**, choose **Shizuku installer**.
   The first install prompts "Allow Aurora Store to access Shizuku?" — tap **Allow all the time**.

After that, Aurora installs Play-Store apps silently, including split APKs — no dialog, no broken
installer (verified end-to-end on a Portal+ installing Spotify). Shizuku's server doesn't survive a
reboot; the kit restarts it on its next run, or run `./provision.sh --shizuku`
(`provision.ps1 -Shizuku`).

#### Simpler alternative: skip Shizuku

Shizuku's server can fail to stay up on some Gen-1 firmware (Android 9 may kill it right after
launch — the kit detects this and tells you instead of falsely reporting success). You can skip
Shizuku entirely: with the installer-overlay fix applied, Aurora's **Session** installer routes
through the now-readable system installer dialog. Set **Aurora → Settings → Installation →
Installation method → Session**, and grant Aurora permission to install apps once:

```bash
adb shell appops set com.aurora.store REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES allow
```

After that, Session installs work with the standard dialog — no Shizuku needed (community-verified on
a Gen-1 Portal+). For apps that ship as split APKs, the Shizuku path above is the more reliable one.

## Releasing

Hosted from this repo:

- [`version.json`](version.json) — the self-update manifest. Devices poll it and update when it
  advertises a higher `versionCode`. Don't hand-edit it — one command cuts a release end to end:
  [`scripts/cut-release.sh`](scripts/cut-release.sh) `<versionName> "<notes>"` bumps
  `app/build.gradle.kts` and `version.json` in lockstep, builds and verifies the signed APK
  (version match + same signing key as the published build), and publishes the GitHub Release with
  the asset named **`immortal.apk`** — the stable `releases/latest/download/immortal.apk` the
  manifest and store catalog point at. It fails fast at every gate. See
  [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).
- [`catalog.json`](catalog.json) — the app-store catalog. Edit and commit; clients pick it up on
  next open (a bundled copy ships as the offline fallback).

Release builds must be signed with the **same** key every time (in-place self-update is
signature-checked). Signing is configured via `keystore.properties`, which the build looks for
first at the repo root (git-ignored) and then at `~/.immortal-signing/keystore.properties` — the
recommended home, since nothing in a git working tree can be considered safe from cleanup. Keep
that key backed up safely (e.g. iCloud) — losing it means devices can no longer self-update.

## Limitations (the honest list)

These are hardware/firmware limits of the Portal itself, confirmed on-device — not things a future
Immortal release can fix:

- **No Google Play Services.** The Portal never had them, and they can't be added (it would need
  Google's own signed software, or system-level write access we don't have). Aurora Store installs
  plenty of apps that work fine, but anything that depends on Google for sign-in, push
  notifications, or DRM may be limited or won't run. microG isn't an option either — the firmware
  has no signature-spoofing support.
- **The bootloader can't be unlocked, so there's no root.** Meta ships the standard "OEM unlocking"
  developer toggle, but the bootloader hard-refuses (`Flashing Unlock is not allowed`) even with it
  enabled, and there's no manufacturer unlock program. This is why the first-gen install helper
  can't be made permanent — root was the only path, and it's welded shut.
- **USB-C thumb drives don't mount reliably.** On the Portal Go the port switches to host mode and a
  drive powers up and enumerates, but the storage stack doesn't bind it, so it doesn't appear as a
  folder. Put screensaver photos on the device's own storage instead (e.g. copy them across while
  it's plugged into your computer).
